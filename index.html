                    <p>I'm a software development student who has spent over a decade in the restaurant industry, where
                        I
                        developed strong communication skills and adaptability from being in high-pressure, fast-paced
                        team
                        environments.
                        Now I work mostly with C#, JavaScript, and SQL with a strong focus on web applications,
                        object-oriented
                        programming, creating and maintaining databases, and project management.</p>

                    <p>One of my favorite things about software development is finding and fixing bugs. There's nothing
                        quite
                        as satisfying as resolving a code-breaking issue and watching everything run smoothly again.
                        I'm also dedicated to lifelong learning, which was a big reason why I decided to pursue my
                        degree in
                        software development.</p>

                    <p>Outside of coding, I like to spend time spoiling my cats, exploring nature, playing video games,
                        dabbling in film photography, learning to ride motorcycles, and cooking delicious meals.</p>
